I am a Developer, Visual and Motion Designer product oriented and lifelong learner. My background started as a creative graphic designer and illustrator that applies its creative urge into the developing process.
This skill set results from a decade of projects with a long array of challenges that started in 2009.  In the UI and Front-End realm, I could gather 3 Awward nominations (Site of the Day) and an Honourable Mention (with ACL Creative).
